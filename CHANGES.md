### 0.4.0

* from scratch rewrite, too many changes to name

### 0.4.1

* altered shape of `manifold.stream/description` for Netty sources and sinks
* made instrumentation of individual connections optional, as it was having a small but measurable performance impact around ~100k connections
* target manifold 0.1.4, byte-streams 0.2.2
